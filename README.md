# GAN-matlab
MATLAB Generative Adversarial Nets.

This source code provides the model to generate vitual MNIST images by using generative adversarial network (GAN) algorithm [1]. I tried to implement GAN without MATLAB inner functions in order to understand GAN algorithm itself; however, there can be some problems.

* If GPU boosting is possible, you can use it.
* 

## Run the demo
```bash
gan.m
```

Other detailed options will be seen in the file gan.m.
